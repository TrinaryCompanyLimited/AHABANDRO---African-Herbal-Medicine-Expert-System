# AHABANDRO
Ahabandro is a web based expert system that facilitates the diagnose, prevention and treatment of Stroke by prescribing African (Using Ghana as a case study) herbal medicine. 
Stroke exemplifies one of the Africa's major health challenges. Stroke is the rapid loss of brain function due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can be due to lack of blood flow or a hemorrhage. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Some of its early signs include sudden loss of memory, loss of speech suddenly, loss of eye suddenly, weakness or numbness with one side of the body, change in mental status, loss of consciousness suddenly, change in character, loss of intelligence, and hypersomnia, bleeding from nose, especially repeated bleeding among others.
There are many causes of stroke but the main ones are always related to high cholesterol level and poor blood circulation:

High blood sugar level causes stroke. Between 30-40% of people who get stroke suffer from diabetes,Heart problem- Embolic and Hypoperfusion are the causes of the heart problem, which result in stroke.

Hypertension is also one of the causes of stroke. 93% of Stroke patients with hemorrhage in the brain suffer from hypertension.

Arteriosclerosis is the main cause of stroke. High cholesterol level is the main cause. 70% of stroke patients are affected by this particular disease

The main objective for developing Ahabandro is to help prevent the prevalence of stroke in Africa (especially in rural communities) using indigenouse knowledge based system and technologies.

# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MODEL
Rapid Application Development (RAD) model will be employed. This means development will be incremental. In RAD model the components or functions are developed in parallel as if they were mini projects. The developments are time boxed, delivered and then assembled into a working prototype.

# THE PROTOTYPE
An incomplete version of the software program will be developed. The prototype  will be developed using PHP and not Python. The prototype will be open source on github  but the Full version which is developed with Python will not be open source. 
Below is the interface design of the prototype though its still an ongoing development:
